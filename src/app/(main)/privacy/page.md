# Privacy Policy

- **Effective Date:** July 2025
- **Owner:** Uzinfocom
- **Platform:** efael.net
- **Contact:** support@efael.net

## 1. Introduction

At Uzinfocom, we believe secure communication is a fundamental right. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect when you use Efael, a decentralized messaging platform built on the Matrix protocol, and how we protect and use that data. We do not sell your information or use it for advertising.

## 2. Scope of This Policy

This policy applies to:

- Our official Matrix homeserver at https://efael.net
- Our Matrix client apps (web, desktop, mobile) branded as Efael
- Any related services directly managed by Uzinfocom

This policy does not apply to:

- Other Matrix homeservers operated by third parties
- Bridges, identity servers, or services not directly controlled by Uzinfocom

## 3. Who We Are

Uzinfocom, a state-owned IT infrastructure provider in the Republic of Uzbekistan, is the data controller for services provided through efael.net.

If you have any questions about this policy, please contact us at:
📧 support@efael.net

## 4. What Data We Collect

a) Information You Provide

- Username, display name, and avatar
- Password (stored securely using hashing and salting)
- Email address or phone number (optional, used only for account recovery or verification)

b) Network and Usage Data

- IP address and user agent (temporarily stored for abuse prevention)
- Device/session identifiers
- Room participation metadata (e.g., when you join a room)

c) Messages and Content

- All private messages and media are end-to-end encrypted using Matrix’s Olm/Megolm protocols.
- Uzinfocom cannot decrypt or access message contents.

## 5. Why We Collect This Data

We collect and process data for the following purposes:

- To operate and maintain your Matrix account
- To enable secure end-to-end communication
- To authenticate logins and sessions
- To monitor platform health, prevent abuse, and detect fraud
- To provide optional services (like account recovery)

We do not track your activity for marketing or advertising purposes. We do not sell or share your data with third parties.

## 6. Federation with Other Servers

Matrix is a federated protocol. If you interact with users on other homeservers (outside efael.net):

- Your Matrix ID (MXID), device keys, and messages may be shared with those servers
- Uzinfocom cannot control how third-party homeservers process data

We recommend you only federate with trusted Matrix homeservers.

## 7. Bridges and Third-Party Services

You may choose to connect your account to third-party services (e.g., Telegram, Slack) via bridges. These integrations are opt-in and handled by external entities.
We do not send data to third parties unless you explicitly initiate such integrations.

## 8. Data Retention

- Session data and logs are kept for up to 180 days for operational and security purposes
- Encrypted message history is retained as long as your account exists, unless you delete it
- You may delete your account at any time, which removes your profile, credentials, and local message history from efael.net

## 9. Security Measures

Uzinfocom implements strong technical and organizational measures to protect your data:

- All passwords are stored using salted hashing (bcrypt)
- End-to-end encryption is enabled by default for private rooms
- Access to infrastructure is restricted to authorized personnel only
- Servers are monitored and patched regularly

## 10. Children’s Privacy

Efael is not intended for users under 16 without parental consent. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.

## 11. Legal Basis and Disclosure

We may process your data based on:

- Your consent (e.g., for email recovery)
- Contractual necessity (to deliver the service)
- Legitimate interest (security, performance)

We will only disclose your data if required by law, court order, or to prevent imminent threats to public safety. We do not access or share end-to-end encrypted content under any circumstances.

## 12. Your Rights

As a user, you have the right to:

- Access your data
- Request correction or deletion
- Object to processing in some cases
- Port your data to another Matrix server
- Withdraw consent for optional data uses

To exercise your rights, contact: support@efael.net

## 13. Policy Updates
