6. Federation with Other Servers

Matrix is a federated protocol. If you interact with users on other homeservers (outside efael.net):

	‚Ä¢	Uzinfocom cannot control how third-party homeservers process data

We recommend you only federate with trusted Matrix homeservers.

7. Bridges and Third-Party Services

You may choose to connect your account to third-party services (e.g., Telegram, Slack) via bridges. These integrations are opt-in and handled by external entities.
We do not send data to third parties unless you explicitly initiate such integrations.

	‚Ä¢	Encrypted message history is retained as long as your account exists, unless you delete it
	‚Ä¢	You may delete your account at any time, which removes your profile, credentials, and local message history from efael.net
